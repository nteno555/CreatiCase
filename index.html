        <p style= "font-family: calibri; margin-left: 30px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-right: 30px; font-size: 22;">
          Our team was founded in 2019 after the iPhone X was released in California. Over the years, we have had over 50 new members join.

          In 2019, our company wanted to build the best phone cases there are by manufacturing an idea of an invincible phone case. This case didn't sell well at first because of competition from Otterbox, another phone case brand. This caused our case not to do as well, and our business lost value. Because of this, we decided to add customizability to our cases, which Otterbox could not compete with. As a result, we were able to save our business and recover from our losses.

         <p style= "font-family:calibri; margin-left: 30px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-right: 30px; font-size: 22;">
          We understood that phone cases must be unique and creative to sell well. Our team had an idea to make a phone case that changes color at the start. That phone case made our business skyrocket, and after that, we wanted our cases to have the same unique effect and creativity that represent people, but make them even more personal. We used all the information we had to create a phone case that offers more personalized customization. This phone case uses an NFC tag on the back of your phone to make the back display an image of your choice. This feature is seamless and very personal. It’s like magic. Our phone cases have now made us millions, and they have been the 4-year in a row award-winning phone case from CNET. We can’t wait to make brighter versions that last longer and offer more protection. We look forward to delivering these custom phone cases to you.

        We differentiate ourselves from other companies by letting the workers choose how the company functions. Instead of having a direct CEO, we listen to our workers’ suggestions and customers' reviews to then apply the advice to our business. 

        Our leaders value creativity and innovation, and are knowledgeable enough to help workers with potential problems and difficulties they have. They also personally teach new workers introduced to the company.

          SWOT Analysis

          <h2 style = "font-family: calibri; margin-left: 30 px; font-size: 40; margin-left: 30px;">
            Strengths
          </head>
             
         <p style= "font-family: calibri; margin-left: 30px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-right: 30px; font-size: 22;">
        <span style="font-weight: normal;">
            Because there are only 50 people in our company, we have great teamwork when faced with problems. This allows our company to be more efficient and productive.
        </span>

        <h2 style = "font-family: calibri; margin-left: 30 px; font-size: 40; margin-left: 30px;">
          Weaknesses
        </head>

          <p style= "font-family: calibri; margin-left: 30px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-right: 30px; font-size: 22;">
            <span style="font-weight: normal;">
                Having 50 people in our company is also a weakness because we cannot produce as many products as other companies with factories in other places. Because of this, we have a more limited stock compared to other companies.
            </span>
          </p>

            Opportunities

          <p style= "font-family: calibri; margin-left: 30px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-right: 30px; font-size: 22;">
            <span style="font-weight: normal;">
                We can leverage our location since our company is based in Silicon Valley. Being in a wealthy area enables us to sell more phone cases because more people own phones. Additionally, with more tech stores nearby, we can draw inspiration and gather materials from the surrounding area.

            Threats
            <h2>

              <p style= "font-family: calibri; margin-left: 30px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-right: 30px; font-size: 22;">
                 <span style="font-weight: normal;">

                    A major threat to our company is competition from other companies. This is because we are a relatively new start-up company, and are less well-known than other companies like Otterbox. This means that they get more sales, which directly affects us by reducing the market.

                To boost the popularity of CreatiCase, we focused on building a strong brand presence and creating a unique phone case. Consistent advertising on social media played a big role in this effort. We also decided to place some ads in newspapers to reach a wider audience, allowing people of all ages to personalize their phones with pictures of loved ones. However, our primary focus is on younger individuals, as they tend to love customizable items and personal touches.

               Our product costs around 5 dollars to make per phone case, as we only need to buy plastic and some metal for our phone cases, and we print the designs directly onto the case. We then sell them for 10 dollars to the public later, which is generally cheaper than our competitors. We then put back around 90% of the money into the company, saving 20% to pay employees. Around 40% of the rest of the money goes into materials, 20% goes into quality control, and 20% goes into the quality of our workspace. The last 10% of the money goes into advertizement. We were first funded out of our own pockets, and after we turned a profit, we were able to find sponsorship from Android. In return, we put the Android logo on the back of cases made for Android phones. After our sponsorship, we expect profits of at least half a million.
